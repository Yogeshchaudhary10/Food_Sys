Momo is made from wheat flour, vegetable oil, chopped onion, garlic, sesame, green chilies, tomatoes, meat (preferably beef), mustard powder, ginger juice and a blend of Nepalese herbal spices.It is common knowledge that the best momo are those that are available on the street corners and small shops. While almost every Indian restaurant serves momo, you bet you can find the same or better taste for a smaller price at a nearby momo stall. Momo are mostly steamed. The traditional momo steamer is called a mucktoo. It is a metal utensil with holes at the base. In many places, bamboo steamers are also used.Momo can also be boiled in meat broth, and even fried after steaming. These fried momo are called pot-stickers or “kothey momo”. In parts of Nepal, Sikkim and north Bengal, you can also get unfilled plain steamed dough called “tingo”. These are often shaped like a lotus for visual appeal.Momo also has a big-brother called thaipo, which is common in Nepal, Sikkim, north Bengal and Ladakh. A thaipo is a truly fat momo- about thrice the size of an ordinary one. The outer covering is also harder than that of a traditional momo. If you polish off two thaipos, you have eaten the equivalent of a full plate of momo. Thaipos are very popular in the north-eastern states.Momo can also be a part of thukpa or traditional Tibetan noodle and soup bowl. In many households and stalls, you can make a hearty meal of momo in meat broth with assorted vegetables.';
